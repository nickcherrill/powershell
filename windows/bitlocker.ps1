# Bitlocker + TPM
<#
.SYNOPSIS
 Enables Bitlocker on a, or a group of, remote computers
.DESCRIPTION
 Designed with automation and scaling in mind, this contains custom error codes for each potential failure point and attempts to enable Bitlocker
.NOTES
 The try{}catch{} blocks are to ensure the correct error code is captured during runtime

Decimal # |Hex #	| Official meaning	| Script's meaning
0	| 0x00000000	| The operation completed successfully	| Bitlocker enabled and backed up to AD successfully
11	| 0x0000000B	| An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format	| Windows version, Bitlocker Drive Readiness or TPM are incompatible
26	| 0x0000001A	| The specified disk or diskette cannot be accessed	| Error adding protectors to the disk
58	| 0x0000003A	| The specified server cannot perform the requested operation	| Key failed to backup to AD
82	| 0x00000052	| The directory or file cannot be created |	Error when enabling Bitlocker
119 | 0x00000077    | The system does not support the command requested. | No TPM chip present
3011| 0x00000BC3    | The requested operation is successful. Changes will not be effective until the service is restarted. | Manual visit required; TPM needed a restart so likely the script will need to be rerun in order to apply Bitlocker
